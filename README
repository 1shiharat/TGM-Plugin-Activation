Version: 		1.0.0
Requires at least: 	3.0
Tested up to: 		3.2.1
 
== Description ==

This class allows WordPress theme authors to include a plugin within their theme for their users to install and activated. Instead of simply including a plugin with the theme and providing directions for FTP, this class makes it easy for the user to install and activate the included plugin by providing admin notices and a form for users to submit.

This class uses the WP_Filesystem Abstraction class to find the best way to install the plugin. WP_Filesystem searches through a number of methods (Direct, FTP, FTP Sockets SSH) and determines the best one for use based on the user's server setup. If FTP is needed, a form will be displayed to prompt users to input their FTP credentials. This class also uses WP_Error to display any errors to users during the plugin installation and activation process. 

== Installation ==

This class is easy to use. Follow these instructions to get it setup.

1. Create a .zip file of your plugin and place it within the tgm-plugin-activation/plugins folder.
2. Within auto-install.php, edit the relevant class variables (they are commented) to reflect your specific plugin.
3. Place the tgm-plugin-activation folder within a /lib folder in your theme ( e.g /wp-content/themes/your-theme/lib/tgm-plugin-activation )
4. Include auto-install.php in your theme's functions.php file ( e.g. require_once( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/lib/tgm-plugin-activation/auto-install.php' ); )
5. Check it out for yourself and give your users more instructions if you desire.
6. Let me know of any issues and be sure to submit your own patches to make it better. :)

== TODO ==

There are lots of things to do with this class (and tons of potential). Here is a short list:

* Allow for plugins to be included from the WordPress Repository
	-this would include downloading the .zip file, installing it and activating it on form submission
* Allow for multiple plugins to be included/installed/activated
* Allow for multiple instances of both included plugins and repo plugins to be installed and activated
* Security and best practices audit
* More testing to catch extraneous errors and issues with WP_Filesystem
